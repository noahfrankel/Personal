In Class Assignment:

- A customer service center tracks how customers
score their service on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is best
and 5 is worst

- The manager of the service center has a display of all
the cumulative scores for all the 100 service
representatives under him (how many times a rep got
each score)

- Using no data structure other than arrays, keep a
running total of how many times each rep got each
score

- Your solution should have (at least) 3 methods:
- A constructor to initialize your D.S.
- Add a new score for a rep
- Get the current score totals for a rep. Values returned by
  this method should not change over time as more scores
  come in - they represent a “point in time”.

HW 1 Assignment

- Change ICA #2 to also track the average score for each
rep for the last 20 scores the rep received

- When/if a rep’s average drops below 2.5, print out to
the system console the following message: “Rep “ +
repID + “’s running average has dropped to “ +
runningAverage. Only print this once for a given drop -
do not print again as long as it stays below 2.5.

- Add the following additional methods:
	- get the average of a rep
	- get both the average as well as the current cumulative scores of a rep
	- reset the average and cumulative scores of a single rep to zero
	- reset the averages and cumulative scores of all reps to zero

- You may not use any data structure other than an
array
